# Deprecated schema guide

This guide has been deprecated to prevent documentation drift. The single canonical schema documentation is:

- `DATABASE_SCHEMA_NEW.md` (root of the repository)

If you need the SQL DDL use `docs/schema_v2.sql`.

If you'd like the visual guide restored later, we can generate a focused `SCHEMA_GUIDE.md` from the canonical file on demand.
